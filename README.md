# Multi-Tool-Research-Agent
This project implements an Agentic AI system capable of autonomous reasoning, multi-step decision-making, and retrieving information from multiple sources (RAG, Arxiv API, Web Search). It uses LangGraph to build a state-driven agent that plans → chooses tools → observes → continues → produces a final answer.
